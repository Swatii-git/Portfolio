 # Portfolio Website ðŸ’»

## Overview
This is my personal **Portfolio Website** created using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It serves as a showcase of my skills, projects, and experience in web development. The site is responsive, visually appealing, and highlights the work I've done as a frontend developer.

Itâ€™s deployed via **GitHub Pages** and accessible publicly online.

## Features
- Responsive design that works on all screen sizes
- Smooth scrolling navigation and sticky header
- Project section showcasing live hosted projects with links
- About Me section with summary and skills
- Contact section with form or contact links (if added)
- Custom styling and animations for a modern look

## How It Works
- The website is a **static site** created using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for minor interactions like smooth scrolling or menu toggling.
- All projects listed in the Projects section are linked to their live GitHub Pages deployments.
- The layout includes sections like:  
  - **Home** (intro banner)  
  - **About Me**  
  - **Projects**  
  - **Skills**  
  - **Contact**

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For semantic structure and layout  
- **CSS**: For styling, layout grids, responsive design, and animations  
- **JavaScript**: For scroll effects, navigation, or interactivity (if used)  
- **GitHub Pages**: For free static site hosting
